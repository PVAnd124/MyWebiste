Leveraging PyAudio, MatPlotlib, and numPy to process audio data from digital stethoscope and provide instant audio visualization feedback for doctors to make an efficient diagnosis. Utilizing React-Native framework to build Frontend for app that acts as an interface for heartbeat measurements through telehealth and provides patients step-by-step directions to record their heartbeat. ML model to check for irregularly patterned heart recordings to assist in diagnosis of pattern-based heart diseases like arrhythmias.",

I work on two projects in the lab. In one, I am building new and improvised machine learning models to diagnose Sepsis at a very early stage to give patients a higher chance of survival. In the other, I am creating new and improvised models to build a medical assistant with a vast knowledge base that will guide decision-making in real time in the clinic.",

        description: "This project was from the 2024 Illini Statistics Datathon hosted by Synchrony Financial at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My team and I built a Decision Tree Classification Algorithm to help Synchrony Financial maximize their Automated Caller Response (IVR) systemâ€™s ability to resolve caller issues without sending the calls to representatives. From a dataset of caller information (i.e. account delinquency, questions asked by the automated caller response system, etc), we calculated the probability of different responses the IVR is programmed to give and using the Decision Tree model, suggested the best questions to ask next in order to best resolve the caller issue without a representative.",
